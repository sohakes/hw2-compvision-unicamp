# Computer Vision Project 2

This is the second project for Unicamp Computer Vision course. The project description and our report are in the root folder.

## How to run

Use docker `adnrv/opencv` to run it.

## What is it?

Although it's in the project description, we implemented Sift, RANSAC and image transformation to stabilize a video (which should be static, with only small translations for it to work). The results weren't that good, but the Sift implementation is decent enough, albeit slow, and can be used as a reference or study. Obviously it is better to use OpenCV or something like that for production code.
